<h3>Planning of the State Machine</h3>
<div>
  <p>In planning out this project, one of the first considerations was what I was going to use a state machine for, and then carefully planning out what the states would be and how their transitions would occur. I wanted something very visual for my example so that it would be easy to see how the machine was behaving and what it was accomplishing. I choose to do a bird because of the large spectrum of visual dichotomous movements they\'re capable of. Figure 2 shows the original plan for the states of the bird.</p>
  <p>Due to time constraints, the number of states had to be scaled back. Figure 2 shows the states currently implemented.</p>

  <figcaption>One of the animations for the bird has endpoints that need to be recalculated after each iteration. I used css variables to accomplish this.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>I wanted a way to transition between the different portions of code that I wished to show, well still allowing the example to be seen at the same time.</figcaption>

plans for future: 
create backend independant of wedding wire to allow for more customization of RSVP Form
Ideally create a RESTful API to accomplish this

events/
---GET how to create an event
---POST create new event

events/{id}
---GET event details

events/{id}/guests
---GET guests for event
---POST add new guest
events/{id}/guests?status=undecided
---GET all guests who haven't RSVP'ed
events/{id}/guests?status=attending
---GET all guests who are attending
events/{id}/guests?status=declined
---GET all guests who declined

events/{id}/guests/{id}
---GET specific guest for event
---PUT update specific guest
---DELETE remove guest
